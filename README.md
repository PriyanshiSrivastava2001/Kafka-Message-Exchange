# KAFKA MESSAGE EXCHANGE
This project demonstrates message exchange between a producer and consumer using Apache Kafka and Python. It's a fundamental introduction to Kafka's message-driven architecture. Producers send messages to Kafka, 
while consumers read and print them. Valuable for beginners, it provides hands-on experience with Kafka's essential functionalities, laying a strong foundation for understanding distributed messaging systems in 
real-world applications.
